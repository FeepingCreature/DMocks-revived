I basically have to include full augmented type info for everything.
Fine.
This info takes the form of a forest.

(We'll handle foreign keys differently.)
The basic idea is, you can go through each DbField in a DbClass, get its name, and perform a query on the table referenced by DbClass. Problem is, you have to create a query string, execute it, and return the results...that means I have to remember the order, I guess.

Then my query will be:
string.format("SELECT {0} FROM {1} WHERE {2} = {3}", csvColumns, dbclass.table, dbclass.key, id);

Remember little Bobby Tables!
