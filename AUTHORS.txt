DMocks-revived project is based on code by Christopher Wright, author of the felt project http://dsource.org/projects/dmocks/. Felt project was abandoned in 2008.
Later, in 2013 part of the project called dmocks was picked up from the Felt codebase to have a working mocking framework for D, called DMocks-revived.
