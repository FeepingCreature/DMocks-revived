Done:
    - Expect(obj.method).Do(delegate) -- execute this delegate in place of obj.method.
    - Exceptions (throw!)

Soon:
    - DOCUMENTATION
    - Ordered expectations.
    - Partial mocks. If there's no expectation, fall back on the base class.

Maybe:
    - Expect(obj.method).PassThrough() -- delegate to the original method.
    - Mock free functions?
        Have to do some sort of manual name mangling, probably. Need a runtime function built to do these mocks. But it's done through multiple successive calls....
    - Thread safety

When I figure out something clever:
    - Don't mock opEquals, toHash if they're the same as the ones in Object. Maybe not anything that's the same as in Object. (Relatively high priority.)
    - Mock templated methods
    - Expect(obj.voidmethod);
