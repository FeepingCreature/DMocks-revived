I should get information on what went wrong with setting up mocks as early as possible.
	Return type? Store the typeid and compare.
	Didn't set an action? Complain the next time you touch the repository.
	etc.

Maybe:
    - Partial mocks. If there's no expectation, fall back on the base class. This will work decently with the passthrough stuff, except -- CONSTRUCTOR NOT CALLED
    - Mock free functions?
        template MockFunc (alias func) {
            ReturnType!(func) mockOfFunc(ParameterTypeTuple!(func)) {}
            void MockFunc () { redirect(&func, &mockOfFunc); }
        }
    - Thread safety
    - Throw an exception if there's no return value, delegate, or exception set up during replay. Ideally, have that happen earlier.
    - Don't mock opEquals, toHash if they're the same as the ones in Object. Maybe not anything that's the same as in Object.

When I figure out something clever:
    - Mock templated methods
	- Mock structures
